\subsubsection*{Description:}
With a double-click on this block, a documentation with all relevant information about the current X2C project can be created. The document will be created in \textit{<ProjectDir>\textbackslash Doc} and will be called \textit{ProjectDocumentation\_<NameOfModel>.pdf}.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\paragraph*{User documentation:}
It is possible to add user specific documentation to the project documentation. When creating the project documentation, the \textit{X2CCode} directory is scanned for the specifed tex file (\textit{UserDoc.tex} by default). If the file is present, it will be included in the documentation.

\paragraph*{Test reports:}
If the checkbox \textit{Add test reports} is selected, test reports of the C-Unit tests of the used X2C blocks are added to the project documentation.

\subsubsection*{Requirements}
In order to generate a documentation in PDF-format a TeX-compiler (e.g. \textit{MiKTeX}) has to be installed. The software tools \textit{Doxygen} and \textit{Graphviz} are recommended to get documentation of the C-code.
