\XtoCBlock{Task Label (Simulink only)}
\label{block:TaskLabel}
\begin{figure}[H]\includegraphics{Icons/TaskLabel}\end{figure} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}
With this block a (sub)system can be given a label which is used for code generation. Blocks with a dedicated Task Label will be grouped into a dedicated X2C update function.

If the label is "TI\_CLA", additional CLA code is generated. This additional code is designed to be used by a CLA (Control Law Accelerator) unit available on certain Texas Instruments processors.
