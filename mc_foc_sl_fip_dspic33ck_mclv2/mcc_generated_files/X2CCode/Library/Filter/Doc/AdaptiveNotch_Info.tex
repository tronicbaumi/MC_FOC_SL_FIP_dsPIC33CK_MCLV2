Calculation:
\begin{equation*}%
    \mathrm{Out(k)}%
        =%
    \begin{cases}%
		\mathrm{In(k)} & \mathrm{n(k)} \le \mathrm{n_{thresh}}\\%
        \mathrm{In(k)} \cdot \mathrm{H(z)} & \mathrm{n(k)} > \mathrm{n_{thresh}}%
    \end{cases}%
\end{equation*}%

The transfer function H(z) of the filter is 
\begin{equation*}%
	H(z) = \frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2}}{1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}}
\end{equation*}%
with coefficients derived from the transfer function
\begin{equation*}%
	H(s) = \frac{s^2 + \omega_0^2}{s^2 + \frac{\omega_0}{Q} + \omega_0^2}
\end{equation*}%
by a matched Z-transformation.
