The table of the LookupTable2D block must contain DimX times DimY data points and they have to be arranged as

\begin{align*}
\textrm{TableData} =& [f(x_1, y_1),\; f(x_2, y_1),\; ...\; f(x_{n-1}, y_1),\; f(x_{n},y_1),\\
                                 &   \phantom{[}\;f(x_1, y_2),\; f(x_2, y_2),\; ...\; f(x_{n-1}, y_2),\; f(x_{n},y_2),\\
                                 &  \phantom{[}\;...\\
                                 &  \phantom{[}\;f(x_1, y_{m-1}),\; f(x_2, y_{m-1}),\; ... \;f(x_{n-1}, y_{m-1}),\; f(x_{n},y_{m-1}),\\
                                 &  \phantom{[}\;f(x_1, y_{m}),\; f(x_2, y_{m}),\; ...\; f(x_{n-1}, y_{m}),\; f(x_{n},y_{m})]
\end{align*}
with n as selected DimX and m as selected DimY values.

For periodic signals, the last entries per dimension must be identical to the first entries in this dimension, see the example in the following figure.

For non-periodic signals there is no restriction regarding the last data points, see the example in the figure below.
